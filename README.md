# streamlit-metabolic-json-modelling

- A streamlit application for metabolic json modelling, analyzing BIGG modelling database json.
- BIGG database for metabolic reactions is located at [BIGG metabolic database](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/)
- There was no metabolic json modelling so i coded this to enable the large metabolic searches.
- Analyze any large metabolic JSON and fetch any interactions, metabolites, GPR rules and Gene Protein Interactions. 
```
git clone https://github.com/gauravcodepro/metabolic-json-modelling.git
conda install streamlit
stream run application.py
